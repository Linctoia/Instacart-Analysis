These are the SQL queries I used to perform and end to end Data Analysis on an Instacart Dataframe. Within my queries
I go through the process of cleaning data, updating tables, creating new tables, and organizing data like "State" location and
"Income" into more useful buckets like "Region of US" and "Income Buckets."


All SQL queries were executed using mySQL Workbench.
